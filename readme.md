| LP2  | Building Accurate Models for Unit Sales Prediction in Favorita Stores using Time Series Forecasting |  [Mediun Link](https://medium.com/@otchie.sonny/building-accurate-models-for-unit-sales-prediction-in-favorita-stores-using-time-series-forecasting-8ebe181e1164) | [PowerBi](/) |

## Project Description
Time series data is a sequence of data points that are indexed and ordered chronologically over time. Time series forecasting is a statistical technique used to make predictions about the future values of a variable based on its past behavior.

Favorita Corporation is an Ecuadorian company that creates and invests in commercial, industrial, and real estate areas. This project aims to forecast unit sales of products across different stores to optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and pricing decisions. The company will adopt this model to help Favorita Corporation make insightful decisions in relation to their retail sales, promotions, and customer satisfaction.

In this article, I will discuss the significant procedures used in building accurate models for sales prediction in Favorita stores using time series forecasting.

## Project Description
Over the last 4 years, India’s start-up ecosystem has been thriving, with entrepreneurs and investors equally looking for the next big idea to disrupt established industries and generate new opportunities. While concepts, creativity, and execution are necessary for a start-up to flourish, they are inadequate on their own. Investor — funding is often necessary to turn those ideas into reality, grow the business, and make a long-term effect. In this article, we will investigate the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021, using a dataset of separate CSV files containing information about the start-ups, funding amounts received, and investors..
