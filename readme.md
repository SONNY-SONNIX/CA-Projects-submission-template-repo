## Project Description
Time series data is a sequence of data points that are indexed and ordered chronologically over time. Time series forecasting is a statistical technique used to make predictions about the future values of a variable based on its past behavior.

Favorita Corporation is an Ecuadorian company that creates and invests in commercial, industrial, and real estate areas. This project aims to forecast unit sales of products across different stores to optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and pricing decisions. The company will adopt this model to help Favorita Corporation make insightful decisions in relation to their retail sales, promotions, and customer satisfaction.

In this article, I will discuss the significant procedures used in building accurate models for sales prediction in Favorita stores using time series forecasting.
