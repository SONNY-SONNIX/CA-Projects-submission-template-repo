Title:
 Crunching the Numbers: A Comprehensive Data Analysis of the Indian Startup Ecosystem from 2018-2021.

Introduction:
Over  the last 4 years, India's start-up ecosystem has been thriving, with entrepreneurs and investors equally looking for the next big idea to disrupt established industries and generate new opportunities. While concepts, creativity, and execution are necessary for a start-up to thrive, they are  inadequate  on their own. Investor â€“ funding  is often necessary to turn those ideas into reality, grow the business, and make a long-term effect. In  this article, we will investigate the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021, using a dataset of separate csv files containing information about the start-ups, funding amounts received, and investors..

Methodology:
To conduct our analysis, we first aggregated the separate csv files for each year of funding and cleaned the data to remove any duplicates or incomplete information. We then used various statistical and data visualization tools to explore the data and identify patterns and trends in the funding received by Indian start-ups over the four-year period.

To begin our analysis, we loaded all the individual dataset from 2018 to 2021. I then perfomed a dataset overview on  each of the datasets to have an idea of the column names , non-null counts and datatypes . I proceeded to the preprocessing phase of the project  where  I cleaned the data to remove any duplicates or incomplete information , employed the use of  CrunchBase to fill in the missing rows  and verified the datatype of each row . I then  aggregated  the individual csv files for each funding year. I then dropped all columns that  were of least relevance  to  the analysis. 

 I conducted univariate analysis on the  combined data  which  revealed some  discrepancies such as missing values stage , sector  and HeadQuaters columns . A boxplot visualization also highlighted  some outliers on the  amount column . I filled this missing data using  mode for the  sector and stage  column . The median was used to fill missing values in the amount column . Whilst the geolocator  help to fill in the  missing values for the Headquaters columns . I continued with my bivariate  analysis , multivariate analysis and feature processing.

I explored the data using different statistical and data visualization tools to identify patterns and trends in the funding received by Indian start-ups over a four-year period.  I used my analysis to answer the various questions  I related to the dataset.
Finally I save data and uploaded it in powerBI where I plotted different graphs to provide deep understanding and insight revealed from our analysis.
